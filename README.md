# Treetops Showdown

Created: *April 18th 2016*

Experimenting with creation of game made in HTML 5 and Javascript. Intended to be similar to Clash of Clans, where two users create units (spending resources) that automatically march and attack the enemies keep.

Didn't get very far, but demonstrates basic use of HTML 5 canvas, and using Javascript to load / manage graphic resources, create a game loop, and some basic implementation for animations.
